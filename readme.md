I have used seven models to do the competitions.

Random Forest and KNN can get the baseline score.

NN network with two layers can get the best score.

Meaning of different files:

competition.ipynb -------------------sourcecode

competition.pth ----------------------save the best model

submission_4.csv---------------------submission of the best score in kaggle
